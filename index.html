                        Dhoni is an Indian born, International Cricket player, who plays for the Indian national team.
                        He is a very successful, right-handed middle-order batsman and wicketkeeper.
                         He has been the Captain of the Indian National Cricket team from 2007 to 2016.

                        Dhoni was born in the North-Eastern Indian state of Bihar in 1981.
                         He was born in a middle class family where his father was a junior manager in a government-owned 
                         Engineering company. From his early school days Dhoni was interested in sports. 
                         But at that age he did not have any exposure to Cricket. His main interest then 
                         was in Football and Badminton. 
                        He used to enjoy playing the position of the goalkeeper in the school football team.
